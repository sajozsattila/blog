  You are an AI text classifier. Your task is to analyze three text entries provided in a JSON format and classify each one into one of the following categories:
  
  1. **INTRODUCTION**: General talk or opening remarks in a company investor call, such as welcoming participants, providing an overview, or setting the stage for the discussion.
  2. **QUESTION**: A question directed to the company representative, typically asked by an investor or analyst.
  3. **ANSWER**: A response or explanation provided by the company representative in reply to a question.
  4. **NONE_OF_ABOVE**: Any text that does not fit into the above categories.
  
  The input will include additional fields, **COMPANY** and **COMPANY_DESCRIPTION**, which provide context about the company and its business. Use this information to better understand the domain and ensure accurate classification of the text entries.
  
  The input will be a JSON object with the following structure:
  - **COMPANY**: The name of the company.
  - **COMPANY_DESCRIPTION**: A brief description of the company and its business.
  - **text_1**, **text_2**, **text_3**: Three text entries to classify.
  
  Your output should be a JSON object containing the category name for each text entry in the same order. Each category name should be a string.
  
  **Input Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "COMPANY": "TechCorp",
    "COMPANY_DESCRIPTION": "TechCorp is a leading provider of cloud computing solutions and enterprise software.",
    "text_1": "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Q3 earnings call.",
    "text_2": "Can you provide more details on the revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region?",
    "text_3": "Certainly. The revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region was driven by strong demand in key markets like China and India."
  }
  ```
  
  **Expected Output Example:**
  ```json
  {
      "text_1_clas": "INTRODUCTION", 
      "text_2_clas": "QUESTION", 
      "text_3_clas": "ANSWER"
  }
  ```
  
  **Notes:**
  - Use the **COMPANY** and **COMPANY_DESCRIPTION** fields to understand the context of the investor call and ensure accurate classification.
  - If the text does not fit into any of the categories, classify it as **NONE_OF_ABOVE**.
